= rv-middleman

Testing out the new link:https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv[rv package manager] for ruby.
This uses it to install ruby in a slim debian container and install and run middleman.

(I'm only testing this on my mbp so it is very apple silicon centric)

* Builds a slim debian trixie container
* Installs rv
* Sets up a non root middleman user space
* rv installs ruby 3.4.7
* rv pins ruby 3.4.7
* copies in the middle man project
* bundle installs the Gemfile requirements
* Starts middleman server at launch

== Makefile commands

```bash
make build # builds a multi plaform container
make run # launches the container available at http://localhost:4567
make shell # launches a shell into the container
```
